<p>Climate change is an environmental and existential issue of great urgency, especially for today’s youth. Until recently, the French national school curriculum had not given students much opportunity to learn about climate change (CC), its causes and repercussions, and mitigating measures to reach sustainable climate conditions. This article describes a six-week participatory, experiential workshop that brought together two groups of French students (one age 10 and the other age 16) to learn and teach each other about CC. Older students learned about the Conference of the Parties, COP21 Paris agreement and the IPCC climate findings and recommendations. Together the two groups developed greater understanding about CC, and proposed concrete environmental actions that they could undertake at home and in their local district to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We examine four products of their collaboration:</p>

<ul><li>slide presentations that they created jointly,</li><li>students’ written reflections on learning about sustainability and CC,</li><li>the group’s list of proposed personal and family actions to decrease their carbon footprint, and</li><li>notes from a meeting with local governmental officials.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We draw inferences from these sources, and extract two recurrent themes in the students’ learning. These themes highlight a mismatch between youth’s sense of urgency to respond to the climate emergency and the older generation’s sluggish pace of addressing it. This article is a qualitative case study of a successful attempt to raise students’ awareness of sustainability and climatic issues, and to involve them in thinking collaboratively with others about the tasks ahead to address the problem of climate change from a local perspective.</p>

<p><em>“Today’s children will likely confront challenges we can hardly begin to imagine in a radically altered, unrecognizable world. Can we responsibly continue preparing them for business as usual? And if not, what can we do to make them ready for a survival game in which wild cards rule?”</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2015, before sustainability became embedded in the French curriculum, the co-authors of this article believed, like Diane Dumanoski, that today’s children must be prepared for the radically altered world that they stand to inherit. We (Larose and Blaisot) designed an experiential workshop to introduce the basics of sustainability and sustainable development to our students through the lens of climate change. This article will describe and analyze the students’ learning from the workshop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, sustainability education is required to be present in both the French primary (<em>école</em>) and secondary school (<em>lycée</em>) curricula; its presence was reinforced in 2019 by the national curriculum agency:&nbsp;<em>Conseil supérieur des programmes</em>&nbsp;[<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#ref-CR2">2</a>]. The initiative is called&nbsp;<em>E3D</em>, which stands for&nbsp;<em>École/Établissement en Démarche de Développement Durable</em>&nbsp;(School Moving Towards Sustainable Development). Through this initiative, every staff member and student in each school building would play a part in the process of implementing concrete solutions in line with the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#ref-CR3">3</a>] in the areas pertaining to school and facility management, such as energy and water usage, waste reduction, recycling and disposal, landscaping, and throughout all levels of classroom lessons. This vision has not yet been fully achieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High school teachers are more constrained to a specific curriculum (which currently does not include content on sustainability) in order to prepare students for their level exams. For this reason, our students who chose to take this&nbsp;<em>optional</em>&nbsp;project in&nbsp;<em>Première</em>&nbsp;(age 15–16, equivalent to US junior year), spent an extra hour of learning outside the normal school day for the 6-week duration of the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article describes a six-week collaborative experiential workshop that brought together two groups of French students, (age 10 and ages 15–16) to learn and teach each other about climate change (CC). The older students learned about the Conference of the Parties (COP21) Paris agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate findings and recommendations. Together the two groups developed greater understanding about CC and proposed concrete environmental actions that they could take to their families and their local communities in order to promote climate sustainability. This collaboration was one of four award-winning curriculum projects in the field of sustainable development at the&nbsp;<em>Concours des clés au développement durable</em>&nbsp;(Contest of keys to SD) during France Climate Week in 2015. The award was presented by the Minister of Education, Najat Vallaud Belkasem.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Co-authors Larose and Blaisot undertook this project with their students in 2015, before the national sustainability curriculum was instituted; it occurred at a time when the topic of sustainability became prominent in the news media because of the UN-SDGs [<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#ref-CR3">3</a>] and the UN Climate Change Conference, (The 21st Conference of Parties, or COP 21) held in Paris in November–December 2015. This is one reason why the authors chose to create this particular workshop. It is likely that students were also hearing the news and developed interest in registering for this workshop.</p>

<p>In this article we distinguish between the two age groups by referring to the older learners as ‘<em>students</em>’ and to the younger learners as ‘<em>pupil</em>s’. While the two age groups were at very different developmental levels, their performance in this collaborative project would allow them to learn from and with each other, and gain crucial twenty-first century sustainability literacy skills such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Gaining fundamental knowledge about environmental sciences: Many articles are featured by newspapers, television and other social media on issues of sustainability and climate change, but the notions and the terminology remain hazy in the minds of many people.</li><li>The ability to assess different kinds and sources of information: Students used scientific approaches to learn how scientists study climate change and make projections into the future, and learned that the models have to take into account many parameters and uncertainties. Climate skeptics use these uncertainties to argue that we are not in a drastic situation. Students learned to rebut such skeptics’ arguments.</li><li>Learning about responsible, realistic and hopeful behaviors: Students learned and in turn taught their parents about sustainability and climate change, without succumbing to catastrophic-thinking.</li></ul>

<h2 id="Sec2">Research question</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our research question was: How can we engage our students and pupils in a learning experience that will make them aware of the challenges of sustainability in our society? What are effective ways of involving them in sustainability issues?</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#Sec3">Methods</a>&nbsp;section, we describe our six-week experiential workshop that engaged the two groups to learn about sustainability together; we used four of their work-products to assess what they learned and gain insight into how aspects of the workshop promoted their learning. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#Sec4">Results</a>&nbsp;section we describe these student-pupil work-products:</p>

<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#Sec9">Discussion</a>&nbsp;section we discern two themes that emerged from these student-pupil work products and we draw some inferences about their learning during these experiences. These observations and remarks will be of a qualitative nature because of the real-world setting and ungraded nature of our project. As this was a curricular project of an experiential nature for students, pupils and teachers together, the learners are not considered ‘subjects’ of a study, and no special permissions or board reviews were necessary. In the interests of confidentiality, no student is identified by name here; likewise for the town officials whom the students interviewed as part of the project.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Climate change (CC) is one of the biggest challenges of our times and is one of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) [<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#ref-CR3">3</a>] to transform our world; SDG13 is dedicated to Climate Action. In addition, the climate ramifications of GHG emissions feature in several other SDGs, such as SDG2 zero hunger, SDG3 good health, SDG6 fresh water availability, SDG7 energy efficiency, SDG11 sustainable cities, and SDG16 peace and (climate) justice. In fact, many argue that the climate is at the core of all 17 goals, since it provides the habitable living spaces and food resources we need for survival. In the French high school curriculum, climate change is only taught during the last year, and only when students choose the specialty ‘Biology and Earth Sciences’. In the absence of formal curriculum content, Larose conceived this project because she believes it is crucial that students get involved in this topic earlier in their learning, regardless of their academic studies and specialties. Co-author Blaisot, a teacher in primary school, was equally interested in early learning about sustainability, and both authors decided to organize a 6-week experiential learning collaboration between the two groups of learners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eight students and 27 pupils attended the workshop, hoping to gain scientific knowledge about CC. Furthermore, they wanted to understand the COP21 commitments that they were hearing about in the French news. This agreement of 197 negotiating parties marked the first time that a comprehensive universal agreement was reached in the fight against CC. The French president called on the entire world to transform the Paris Accord on Climate into actions to confront this urgent problem [<a href="https://sustainableearth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42055-022-00048-x#ref-CR4">4</a>].</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two age groups worked independently in their separate schools for the first 3 weeks, to prepare for the joint-sessions with each other to occur in the last 3 weeks. The primary school curriculum system offered the advantage of being able to work on the project for entire days rather than only 1 h per week. As this was a multi-disciplinary project, students and pupils were able to draw on a wide range of disciplines as they delved into learning about climate change and sustainable behaviors .</p>

<p>In November of the following year, the pupils who had been elected “Eco-delegates” by their classmates took part in the youth forum on climate with delegates from other primary, middle and high schools in the Rouen school region, a convention held at the Regional Authority Headquarters. They heard a keynote on the causes and consequences of CC. Then they took the floor to present their ideas for reducing GHG emissions and their impact on the planet. Following this, they took part in thematic workshops. After the convention the pupils took these ideas into the middle school where they presented their project to students in the level ahead of them.</p>

<h2 id="Sec4">Results</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither group of students received traditional grades for their work during the workshop. However, to assess what students had learned from the project, the collaborating teachers used evidence from four types of student/pupil work:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Student-pupil-created slide presentations that illustrated the knowledge that they had acquired;</li><li>Written reflections on their learning;</li><li>Preparations for and participation in a discussion with Mrs. H at the local Town Hall;</li><li>Creation of two lists of sustainable-living actions, one for their parents and one to propose to the town authorities.</li></ul>

<h3 id="Sec5">Co-created slide shows</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the third week of the workshop, the secondary students prepared for meeting the pupils the following week. Each student chose a topic from this list: Consumption, Agriculture, Water Management, Biodiversity, Population migrations within and across national borders, Health, Energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They used critical thinking to choose pictures, graphs and statistical figures among resources proposed by their teacher. They were to use these communication supports to explain the worldwide consequences of global warming. Each group of students chose supporting evidence, then showed and explained their choices to the others. The larger group debated and selected the best illustrative evidence, and organized their documents to create a single slideshow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly at the primary school, the pupils did the same work. Three or four children per group prepared a slideshow using the same topics but concentrating on the more localized consequences of global warming in France. This task was more difficult for them because it was the first time that they had used digital tools to make slideshows. They learned to choose visuals that would illustrate their words, in order to engage their audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In week four, the two groups met together: five or six pupils worked with one student on their chosen topic, and both age-groups’ slideshows were used to create a final presentation for each of the eight topics.
