<p>Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary">convergent boundaries</a>, two plates come together; at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary">divergent boundaries</a>, two plates are pulled apart; and at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_boundary">transform boundaries</a>, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake">earthquakes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism">volcanic activity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny">mountain-building</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench">oceanic trench</a>&nbsp;formation can occur.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-kious_tilling1999-126">[119]</a></sup>&nbsp;The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-seligman2008-127">[120]</a></sup></p>

<p>As the tectonic plates migrate,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust">oceanic crust</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction">subducted</a>&nbsp;under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than&nbsp;100&nbsp;Ma&nbsp;old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be&nbsp;200&nbsp;Ma&nbsp;old.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-duennebier1999-128">[121]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-noaa20070307-129">[122]</a></sup>&nbsp;By comparison, the oldest dated&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust">continental crust</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;4,030&nbsp;Ma,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-cmp134_3-130">[123]</a></sup>&nbsp;although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to&nbsp;4,400&nbsp;Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#cite_note-science310_5756_1947-57">[52]</a></sup></p>
