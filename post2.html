<p><strong>Earth</strong>, third planet from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun">Sun</a>&nbsp;and the fifth largest planet in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>&nbsp;in terms of size and mass. Its single most outstanding feature is that its near-surface&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/environment">environments</a>&nbsp;are the only places in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/universe">universe</a>&nbsp;known to harbour life. It is designated by the symbol ♁. Earth’s name in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/English-language">English</a>, the international language of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy">astronomy</a>, derives from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-English-language">Old English</a>&nbsp;and Germanic words for&nbsp;<em>ground</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>earth</em>, and it is the only name for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-system">solar system</a>&nbsp;that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology.</p>

<p>Since the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Copernican-Revolution">Copernican revolution</a>&nbsp;of the 16th century, at which time the Polish astronomer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolaus-Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>&nbsp;proposed a Sun-centred&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Copernican-system">model</a>&nbsp;of the universe (<em>see</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/heliocentrism">heliocentric system</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enlightened">enlightened</a>&nbsp;thinkers have regarded Earth as a planet like the others of the solar system.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Concurrent">Concurrent</a>&nbsp;sea voyages provided practical proof that Earth is a globe, just as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei">Galileo</a>’s use of his newly invented telescope in the early 17th century soon showed various other planets to be globes as well. It was only after the dawn of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/space-physics-and-metaphysics">space</a>&nbsp;age, however, when photographs from rockets and orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/spacecraft">spacecraft</a>&nbsp;first captured the dramatic curvature of Earth’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/horizon-astronomy">horizon</a>, that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception">conception</a>&nbsp;of Earth as a roughly spherical planet rather than as a flat entity was verified by direct&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being">human</a>&nbsp;observation. Humans first witnessed Earth as a complete orb floating in the inky blackness of space in December 1968 when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Apollo-space-program">Apollo</a>&nbsp;8 carried astronauts around the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Moon">Moon</a>. Robotic space probes on their way to destinations beyond Earth, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Galileo-spacecraft">Galileo</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Near-Earth-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Shoemaker">Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous</a>&nbsp;(NEAR) spacecraft in the 1990s, also looked back with their cameras to provide other unique portraits of the planet.</p>

<p>Viewed from another planet in the solar system, Earth would appear bright and bluish in colour. Easiest to see through a large telescope would be its atmospheric features, chiefly the swirling white&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cloud-meteorology">cloud</a>&nbsp;patterns of midlatitude and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/tropical-storm">tropical storms</a>, ranged in roughly latitudinal belts around the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/planet">planet</a>. The polar regions also would appear a brilliant white, because of the clouds above and the snow and ice below. Beneath the changing patterns of clouds would appear the much darker blue-black oceans, interrupted by occasional tawny patches of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/desert">desert</a>&nbsp;lands. The green landscapes that harbour most human life would not be easily seen from space. Not only do they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute">constitute</a>&nbsp;a modest fraction of the land area, which itself is less than one-third of Earth’s surface, but they are often obscured by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cloud-meteorology">clouds</a>. Over the course of the seasons, some changes in the storm patterns and cloud belts on Earth would be observed. Also prominent would be the growth and recession of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/winter">winter</a>&nbsp;snowcap across land areas of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Scientists have applied the full battery of modern instrumentation to studying Earth in ways that have not yet been possible for the other planets; thus, much more is known about its structure and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition">composition</a>. This detailed knowledge, in turn, provides deeper insight into the mechanisms by which planets in general cool down, by which their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/magnetic-field">magnetic fields</a>&nbsp;are generated, and by which the separation of lighter elements from heavier ones as planets develop their internal structure releases additional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/energy">energy</a>&nbsp;for geologic processes and alters crustal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compositions">compositions</a>.</p>
